# Creating the HelloWold Widget
We already have the basics necessary to do some practice in the framework. In this
section we are going to implement a new widget called HelloWorld. Yet a simple
widget, it only displays the text: "Hello World!", it will give us a little bit
of notion on how it is to work in the framework. 

- [ ] Talk about the Text widget
- [ ] Give the first example by using RichText
- [ ] But that is not enough, we want to learn more about the framework internals, let's go one level deeper: rendex box, etc.
- [ ] Ok, we have created our prototype for our HelloWorld widget, now it is time
to implement some tests. 
- [ ] Let's finish our example with our HelloWorld widget and finish our exercise.
